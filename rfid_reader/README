This folder contains the C files that need to be compiled into the program read_rfid, which extracts experiment data from plant RFID tags on the LemnaTec system. It requires the libnfc and libpq packages in order to compile.

To compile, run:

gcc main.c mifare.c db_connect.c -o read_rfid -lnfc -lpq

The read_rfid program needs to be in the same directory as the script camera_script.py.
