Use 'gphoto2 --auto-detect' to find all attached cameras and which ports they are on, and 'gphoto2 --port [usb:xxx,xxx] --get-config serialnumber' to find the serial number for a certain camera. A connected camera that is not on this list will not be used. The name of the camera (e.g. 'sv' for 'side view') is used in image names to identify the camera.
